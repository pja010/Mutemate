# Mutemate
### Mobile Application Project

If you (or other people)...
* ...get annoyed when your (or someone else's) phone rings loudly in 
social, noise-sensitive places
* ...forget to "unmute" after putting device aside 

then fret no more - Mutemate is your friend in need.

#### Never more worry about "forgetting to mute"
Instead of having to remember to mute (and "unmute") your phone, make the phone do it by itself.

Mutemate automatically sets your phone into vibrate mode when you put it in your pocket
(and sets it back to ringer mode when taken out and put away). Yes I know, very convenient - that's the point (see the next point). 

## A vision of invisible computing tools
This is an app that is not about itself, but about saving people 
from having to bother muting and unmuting their phones. 
from the time
and annoyance of having to mute and unmute their phone.

While this is a little tool that lives within ~300 lines of code, 
it embodies a larger vision of computing tools that are less about maximizing 
"user engagement" (i.e. keeping people's time and attention) and more about thoughtfully and invisibly serving people's 
needs.

### Note
Mutemate relies on proximity sensor hardware (found in nearly all smart phones). 
Some models, including Galaxy S20 and later Samsung devices, use "virtual proximity sensors", which may not work properly with Android's API. 
incl. The app works optimally on Pixel phones. Please keep in mind that this is a Beta version that may need future tweaks,
such as power optimization. If you have feedback, suggestions or wish to collaborate, please feel free to
